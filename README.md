C# Library to easily create botting tool for Growtopia (Works and tested in Windows x64 & Linux x64).

This was used in my old multibot project "Sensum" (latest client releases). And as i no longer have much interest in gt anymore i decided to make this framework public.

Everything should work and world data deserialization should be up to date too has ready to use Actions such as Punch, Placing items to storage box etc.. these can be found in Actions.cs, PathFinder and handles most packets needed bot to handle. Game version and protocol can be updated from App.cs
